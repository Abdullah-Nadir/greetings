# Greeting

## Learning Goals

- Practise working with strings in python
- Practise working with conditionals in python


## Background

In a file called `bank.py`, there's a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output `$0`. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output `$20`. Otherwise, output `$100`. It ignores any leading whitespace in the user’s greeting, it also treats the user’s greeting case-insensitively.
## Usage/Examples

Your program should behave per the examples below.

```
Greeting: Hello, Newman
$0
```

```
Greeting: How's it going?
$20
```

```
Greeting: What's up!
$100
```
